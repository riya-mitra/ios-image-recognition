# iOS Image Recognition App with ResNet50
This project is an iOS application that performs image recognition on-device using Apple's Core ML and the ResNet50 model. The app identifies and classifies objects in real-time, demonstrating an integration of deep learning in a mobile app environment.

## Features
Real-Time Object Recognition: The app leverages the ResNet50 model to detect objects in live camera input or from photos in the gallery.
Offline Processing: All processing happens on-device, ensuring data privacy and usability without an internet connection.
User-Friendly Interface: Simple and intuitive UI, allowing users to capture and analyze images with ease.
## Tech Stack
Swift: Core language for iOS development.
Core ML: Apple's machine learning framework, used for integrating the ResNet50 model into the app.
Vision Framework: Facilitates image processing and analysis in real-time with Core ML models.
